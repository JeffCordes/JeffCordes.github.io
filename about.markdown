Jeff Cordes

Senior Manager, Application Devlopment - [Insight](https://www.insight.com/en_US/home.html)

As a seasoned leader with over 20 years of experience, I have a proved track record of delivering technology solutions and building strong diverse teams.  Throughout my career I have honed my skills in leadership, team management, software development, AI, cloud computing and strategic planning.  I am passionate about using these skills to help developers reach their career goals, and to help organizations make an impact in the market.

I have spent the past six years in consulting spanning a variety of industries and have a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing businesses today.  I believe at the heart of both the challenges and opportunities is the constant change and advancement in technology.  What we fail to learn today, is where we will fall behind tomorrow.
